So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter
Good case Excellent value
Great for the jawbone
Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesMAJOR PROBLEMS
The mic is great
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume
If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one
If you are Razr owneryou must have this
Needless to say I wasted my money
What a waste of money and time
And the sound quality is great
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery
If the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset
Very good quality though
The design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED
So Far So Good
Works great
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last
I went on Motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again
I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it
The commercials are the most misleading
I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging
I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery
Great Pocket PC  phone combination
Ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone Ive had
I didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone
Doesnt hold charge
This is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible
This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone
Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juiceHighy recommended
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phoneBattery life is short
It has kept up very well
Poor Talk Time Performance
The case is great and works fine with the 680
worthless product
It has a great camera thats 2MP and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality
I was not impressed by this product
Nice headset priced right
I only hear garbage for audio
Excellent bluetooth headset
It has all the features I want
Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery
AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS
This case seems well made
Disappointed with battery
Not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should
good protection and does not make phone too bulky
A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget
This phone is pretty sturdy and Ive never had any large problems with it
I love this thing
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie
VERY DISAPPOINTED
I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great
I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end
The buttons for on and off are bad
Essentially you can forget Microsofts tech support
I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool
These headphones were a great find  and I think they are perhaps the best purchase Ive made in the last several years  seriously
Buy a different phone  but not this
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds
A week later after I activated it it suddenly died
It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes
Great for iPODs too
This device is great in several situations1
Mic Doesnt work
Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying
Great choice
Nice docking station for home or work
This is a beautiful phone
Love this product
Do Not Buy for D807wrongly advertised for D807
This is a great little item
I love this phone  It is very handy and has a lot of features 
I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working
I wear it everyday and it holds up very well
Not a good bargain
Well packaged arrived on time and works as intended
The battery runs down quickly
This item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use
The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them
This phone works great
The construction of the headsets is poor
Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper
The phone loads super
For a product that costs as much as this one does I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does
Made very sturdy
Worked great
The ear buds only play music in one ear
Dont waste your money
Will order from them again
If you plan to use this in a car forget about it
I found this product to be waaay too big
Best Ive found so far  Ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using
Im very disappointed with my decision
Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone
Buyer Beware you could flush money right down the toilet
Definitely a bargain
The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger
ProsGood camera  very nice pictures  also has cool styles like black and white and more
Thats a huge design flaw unless Im not using it correctly which I dont think is the case
I love my 350 headset My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit
The camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution
I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work
Sound quality on both end is excellent I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2
This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case
Great product fast shipping
Absolutely great
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it
It is very comfortable on the ear
It has been a winner for us
Setup couldnt have been simpler
Ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one Ive found that fits my ear comfortably
Could not get strong enough signal
Iam very pleased with my purchase
Bad Quality
Gets the job done
Great audio
Basically the service was very bad
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger
Ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but I really like it
The BT headset was such a disapoinment
It is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it
The accompanied software is almost brilliant
Headset works great  was packaged nicely to avoid any damage
I definitly recommend
BuyerBe Very Careful
The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed
Very good stuff for the price
My headset works just peachykeen
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement
Voice recognition is tremendous
What a waste
During several different 2 minute calls I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars
I was not happy with this item
very disappointed
The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally
I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and Im glad I did
What a waste of time
Its reception is very very poor
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED
After 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden
I Was Hoping for More
Audio Quality is poor very poor
I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve
I know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellWell this one works great
Ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these
This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used
Nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there
This item is fantastic and works perfectly
And I just love the colors
W810i is just SUPERB
All I can do is whine on the Internet so here it goesThe more I use the thing the less I like it
Great charger
This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate
Works like a charm it work the same as the one I got with the phone
I still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans
Great Value
Doesnt work at all I bougth it for my L7c and its not working
The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics
doesnt last long
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side
EXCELLENT SERVICE
Thank you for wasting my money
How can that beThe audio quality is poor
The iGo chargers and tips are really great
The file browser offers all the options that one needsHandsfree is great
Superb Phone on a Great Network
I connected my wifes bluetoothMotorola HS850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case
I put the latest OS on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you
Dont buy this product
Ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear
The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome
I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side I really abhor it
I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected
Incredible
Design Flaw
Great phone
Waste of 13 bucks
But when I check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then Im lost
The replacement died in a few weeks
Any ring toneOverall good phone to buy
Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone
I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more
Not impressed
Light weight I hardly notice it is there
Youll love how thin it is
Bad Choice
The pleather case doesnt fit
useless phone simply deaf
The color is even prettier than I thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp
All in all I think it was a good investment
It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call
The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters
Battery lasts only a few hours
great headset very impressed  H500
The 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7
Ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me
Good transmit audio
We are sending it back
I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway
If you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means
Great price also
The range is very decent Ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues
fast service
I would highly recommend this
I would recommend this
I also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use
WORST PHONE EVER
Im still infatuated with this phone
Freezes frequently4
Its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is
Simple lightweight and great fit
All in all Id expected a better consumer experience from Motorola
Theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before
These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent
I usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight  doesnt mess up my hair
Im a bit disappointed
I have had this phone for over a year now and I will tell you its not that great
I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once thats when I first used it
The battery is completely useless to me
What a big waste of time
Dont waste your  on this one
Great sound and service
Really pleased with this product so far
One of my favorite purchases ever
best bluetooth on the market
Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort I recommend you this case 
I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute
Do not make the same mistake as me
Big Disappointment with calendar sync
the phone was unusable and was not new
Worst Customer Service Ever
No additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever
It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset
Worth every penny
Excellent wallet type phone case
Nice headphones for the price and they work great
Internet is excrutiatingly slow
It is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case
Its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable
O my gosh the best phone I have ever had
Its very attractive and appears to be of good quality
I love all the features and form factor
This product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it
poor quality and service
The cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary
Great Earpiece
Excellent hands free tool
Great for using with your home stereo
Good product  incredible value
Only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far
Works great
Absolutel junk
THAT one didnt work either
Battery life is real good
Returned 8 hours later
Its a great item
Dont waste your money
Love this headset
Not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it
Worked perfectly
Unreliable  Im giving up
I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality
Avoid this one if you can
Reversible plug works great
I wasted my little money with this earpiece
Very good phone
Best of all is the rotating feature very helpful
Comfort for our whole family
Good product good seller
I love this bluetooth
First of all it doesnt wear well
I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics
I got it because it was so small and adorable
Great phone
I wouldnt recommend buying this product
Piece of Junk
Poorly contstruct hinge
This item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems
Great Phone
Dont buy it
Excellent Phone
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE
The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent
This is hands down the best phone Ive ever had
Works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen
This one works and was priced right
Customer service was terrible
Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i
Sending it back
Now I know that I made a wise decision
Someone shouldve invented this sooner
Good price
Everything worked on the first tryThe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good
I received it quickly and it works great
Has been working great
As many people complained I found this headsets microphone was very weak
My 5year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this
They do not care about the consumer one bit
This is a good battery and it got here really fast
The instruction manual is lacking
Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case
Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new
The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena
Its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone Razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an LG
We have gotten a lot of compliments on it
This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving
I want my money back
I love this device
I am also very happy with the price
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately
The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds
I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem
I have 23 bars on my cell phone when I am home but you cant not hear anything
good item low price
Howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games
The plug did not work very well
AMAZON SUCKS
Rip off Over charge shipping
VERY comfortable
The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago
The reception is excellent
It fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2
Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive
Very disappointing
It was an inexpensive piece but I would still have expected better quality
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it
Excellent sound quality
Was not happy
A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS
New Battery works great in phone
Worst customer service
Ive dropped my phone more times than I can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood
Reception is terrible and full of static
Good audio quality
This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier
I was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal
Were JERKS on the phone
Works like a charm Works as advertised
Comfortable Nice Range Good Battery Life
Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible
Excellent starter wireless headset
The loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very  appealing
The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset
First off the reception sucks I have never had more than 2 bars ever
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT
The microphone also works well but according to people I have called it applifies everything
Nice design and quality
Also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down
It is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission
bad fit way too big
It definitely was not as good as my S11
awesome device
Waste of money
I had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product
Love This Phone
I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that Ive got it I couldnt be happier
Ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason
Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year
Battery life is also great
The worst phone Ive ever had Only had it for a few months
Not a good item It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player
This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear
Protects the phone on all sides
This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network
Clear Skype Calls Long Battery Life Long Range
Soyo technology sucks
Great Hands Free Device
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool
Same problem as others have mentioned
After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well
Magical Help
The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service
Poor sound quality
The best phone in market 
It worked very well
The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well
Exactly what I wanted
The picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today
This is a great deal
Excellent product I am very satisfied with the purchase
I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try
Better than youd expect
Using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear
Great product and price
Sounds good reasonably priced and effective Its that simple 
Still Waiting Im sure this item would work well if I ever recieve it
what a disappointment
Very prompt service
Excellent product for the price
Very pleased with this headset
dont waste your money and time
I especially love the long battery life
Its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out
Works great
Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy
I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing I noticed was the really bad service
Ill be looking for a new earpiece
I highly recommend this device to everyone
Jawbone Era is awesome too
We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week  but still lasts longer than thereplacement
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset
I have used several phone in two years but this one is the best
An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000
This is the first phone Ive had that has been so cheaply made
Att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk
The plastic breaks really easy on this clip
Price is good too
Dont make the same mistake I did
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone
Im using it with an iriver SPINN with case and it fits fine
Also the area where my unit broke Im not too fond of the magnetic strap
Overall I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it
Another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model
ITS REALLY EASY
My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect
Fantastic earphones
It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car
Low Quality
I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone
But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone Ive had before
Warning  Stay away
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money
Awsome Device Works Great
I used to talk on it for 1  1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying
If you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyI would not recommend this to anyone
Very Displeased
I might have gotten a defect but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install
Restored my phone to like new performance
I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q go figure
I searched the Internet and found this one to be the best value
Does not fit
Very happy with this product
The screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone
Theres really nothing bad I can say about this headset
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced
Portable and it works
My colleague  I now get great receptionA little expensive but performance is great
I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20  left in the morning
Ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses
Timely shipment and quality product
Nice solid keyboard
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly
Horrible phone
BT50 battery junk
We would recommend these to others
Cant get the software to work with my computer
Disappointed
poor voice clarity
The battery works great
No buyers remorse on this one
Very disappointed in AccessoryOne
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers
Looks great and is strong
I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now and I am pretty happy with it
The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome
Disappointment I hate anything that goes in my ear
Great software for Motorolas
The delivery was on time
Very easy to use
Uncomfortable In the Ear Dont use with LG VX9900 EnV
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown
It holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous
Id like to return it
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I dont expect any problems
Verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple
After charging overnight these batteries work great
You wont regret it
I love this phone
A Disappointment
Its not user friendly
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect
Then I exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute
This PDA rocks
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service
Pretty piece of junk
Plug was the wrong size
Works as described
Save your money Ive had this item for 11 months now
Bad Purchase
WELL IM SATISFIED
The bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a NYC commuter
This battery is an excellent bargain
Defective crap
I would have given no star if I was able
I wear glasses and it fits fine with them
The sound quality for the device is unacceptableUnless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing
I would not recommend this item to anyone
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad
greatno problems at all
As an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens
This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far
very good product well made
Mobile Phone Tools are a must have
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone
I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall I am very excited to have this source
The phone is sturdy and waterproof
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead
I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great
Works great
REALLY UGLY
horrible had to switch 3 times
The noise shield is incrediable
No real improvement
Razr Battery  Good buy
Keep up the good work Amazon
They refuse to refund or replace
Unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing
Great case and price
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedI am not impressed and I am not laughing
Bluetooth range is good  a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch
Small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly
I am glad I purchased it
Ive missed numerous calls because of this reason
Perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when I use this
Dont buy this product
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone
No shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch NOTHINGI couldnt be more happier with my new one for the Droid
Worst software ever used If I could give this zero stars I would
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better
I love the camera its really pretty good quality
Thank you for such great service
Its a total package
The seller is very understanding and patient I would definitely buy from them again
I give Wirefly 1 starI will contact CingularATT and inform them of this practice
Its AGGRAVATING
Great product for the price
I have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use
Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone
None of it works just dont buy it
Muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off
Please dont waste your money
All in all Im quite satisfied with this purchase
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking this isnt it
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design
Disapointing Results
Cumbersome design
Great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then I expected
Great Product
Its A PIECE OF CRAP
My experience was terrible This was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra which I HATED
This fixes all the problems
Worst ever
I am very happy
Ive had no trouble accessing the Internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions
I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what
The battery life is highly unacceptable
That company is a joke
It does everything the description said it would
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset
It works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time
Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data
Voice Quality Signal Strength Dropped Calls
It plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not
Better than expected
It feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them
Battery is holding up well
Also difficult to put onId recommend avoiding this product
I only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokenI went to plug it in and it started smoking
Sprint  terrible customer service
Linked to my phone without effort
THey are so cool
Easy to use
Better Than New
What possesed me to get this junk I have no idea
Piece of trash
A pretty good product
This is a great phone
For the price on Amazon it is an excellent product which I would highly recommend
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what theyre doing
The real killer is the volume and of course it breaking
Those phones are working just fine now
I am more than happy with this product
Poor Construction
This is infuriating
Overall I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman
Sprint charges for this service
It is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on
It doesnt work in Europe or Asia
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy Samsung E715 is the worst i have ever seeen
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone
Poor product
However I needed some better instructions
You need two hands to operate the screenThis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC using a USB Bluetooth transceiver
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS
This is a great product sure beats using your fingers
Plus I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point
All the other cases Ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul
Very Dissapointing Performance
Dont make the same mistake that I did and please dont buy this phone
This phone might well be the worst Ive ever had in any brand
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family
Dont bother  go to the store
I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the Fire Red and its a great color
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed
You get what you pay for I guess
Not only did the software do a great job of this I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it
These are fabulous
However BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up
I used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phoneThe price of the cable was excellent
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer
Performed awful  muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call
Very windresistant
Obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for
They do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceEasy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried
I contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if I couldnt produce my receipt I was out of luck
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are
Great phone
When I placed my treo into the case not only was it NOT snug but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides
Im pleased
Battery is terrible
I found the product to be easy to set up and use
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear
Utter crap Sound quality is TERRIBLE
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work
No ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great
Finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor
The handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the Treo rebootsOverall I still rate this device high
Talk about USELESS customer service
It felt too light and tinny
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in
Im happy about this purchase good quality and low price
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones
Its welldesigned and very sharp  the blue is a very nice color
Does everything it should and more
I could not recommend these more
Nice Sound
Looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with
Setup went very smoothly
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it
A must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off
It is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping
Cant upload ringtones from a third party
Bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked
Truly awful
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did
The volume for the ringer is REAL good you have choices how loud
And none of the tones is acceptable
camera color balance is AWFUL
This product is clearly not ready for prime time I dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat
Chinese Forgeries Abound
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell
The instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well
Too bad you have to pay up to  a month for the service
Works well
The nokia CA42 USB cable did not work with my phone
Clear crisp sound
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well
The biggest complaint I have is the battery drains superfast
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips
It doesnt make you look cool
Because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all
Comfortable fit  you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day
Also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s preferably ripped by Windows Media Player
You cant beat the price on these
 Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash SOS signals seriously
lightweight and works well
So just beware
I love this cable  it allows me to connect any miniUSB device to my PC
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i
Cant store anything but phone numbers to SIM
It lasts less than 3o minutes if I actually try to use the phoneMy wife has the same phone with the same problem
Poor quality
jabra ear gels R the best
Not worth it
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced
It quit working after Id used it for about 18 months so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset Ive ever owned
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources iMac external battery wall outlet etc
It was a great phone
if you simply want a small flip phone  look elsewhere as the extra bells  whistles are mediocre
Good value works fine  power via USB car or wall outlet
My phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality
Think it over when you plan to own this oneThis sure is the last MOTO phone for me
In the span of an hour I had two people exclaim Whoa  is that the new phone on TV
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional
Other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape
It has everything I need and I couldnt ask for more
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke
This product is great it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears
TMobile has the best customer service anywhere
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months Pros
Provides good protection and looks classy too
Krussel Always good
The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc
The design is very good4
I great reception all the time
I would highly recommend this product
Couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in Texas
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320
Bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you
Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
stay away from this store be careful
This BlueAnt Supertooth handsfree phone speaker is AWESOME
Does not fit
 Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCHr450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs
It is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time
disappointing
Blue Ant is easy to use
Cheap but hey it works Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors Id rather be using a disposable then this
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use
Its very convenient and simple to use  gets job done  makes the car ride so much smoother
The nano stated itMy son was dissapointed
The sound quality is excellent as well
Its the best headset I have used
Would not reccommend
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that I have found to date
Just what I wanted
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone
wont work right or atleast for me
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic
But now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccureBottom line put your money somewhere else Cingular will not support it
I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for meThe good
Great product
Crisp and Clear
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes
VERY cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor
I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones I have not had this problem
The reception has been generally good
Excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot
Great bluetooth
I highly recommend this case
WORTHWHILE
This is a great deal
After my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part
I am sorry I made this purchase
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear
Treo and TMobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount
It was horrible
I dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first
They work about 2 weeks then break
It is simple to use and I like it
Its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementOh be sure to use ActiveSync 42 for optimal data synchronization results
I cant use this case because the smell is disgusting
NOT WHAT I WANTED
I own 2 of these cases and would order another
Great Phone
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and Im very happy with my purchase
The internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked
Perfect for the PS3
Five star Plus plus
A good quality bargain I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me
50 Down the drain
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasnt great
Good  works fine
For the price this was a great deal
Great price too
If there is a wind it is completely useless
Yes its shiny on front side  and I love it
Does Not Work
At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at 744 until I plugged it into my phone V3c Razr
The reception through this headset is excellent
2 thumbs up to this seller
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight
Improper description I had to return it
1 It Works  2 It is Comfortable
Battery chargelife is quite long
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well
Battery has no life
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing
Product is exactly as described
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones wont
Doesnt do the job
I would recommend it
Plan on ordering from them again and again
That being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one
They keep getting better and better this is my third one and Ive had numerous Palms too
Awkward to use and unreliable
The shipping time was also very quick
Not as good as I had hoped
Good case
Doesnt Work
Really good product
Unfortunately it did not work
All three broke within two months of use
dont buy it
My father has the V265 and the battery is dying
However the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one
The calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently
Horrible horrible protector
I dont like this Nokia either
Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be3
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE
Terrible My car will not accept this cassette
Product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with
Its not what it says it is
Stay Away From the Q
Used and dirty
Very unreliable service from Tmobile 
Not good enough for the price
I bought two of them and neither will charge
It looks very nice
This is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer
I have read others reviews here but I havent had any problem with it
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet
Comfortable in my hand
Just does not work
Poor Reliability
It works
If I take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing
Terrible product and waste of money
Last time buying from you
It was a waste of my money
So far it has worked like a charm
I have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good
But in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone
Would recommend this item
Its been my choice headset for yearsGreat sound good volume good noise cancellation
Nice case feels good in your hands
The item received was Counterfeit
Just really good So far probably the best BT headset I have ever had
Works fine
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it
I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip
My sister has one also and she loves it
Good Quality
This is by far the worst purchase Ive made on Amazon
Excellent dualpurpose headset
Excellent
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125
It seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iPhone inside
The bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from Sprint
Having trouble with volume
The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears
WARNING  DO NOT BUY
I am pairing this with my iphone and I could not be happier with it so far
When it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off
I didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort
Best headset ever
Dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support
It was that loudGlad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap
Fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips
Excellent product for the price
Bad Reception
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP
It was quite comfortable in the ear
Great phone
Dont buy this product  It fails
Everything about this product is wrongFirst
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature
This was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts
Terrible phone holder
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly
I love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look
But despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product
How stupid is that
I can hear while Im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors
Good show Samsung
So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed
Couldnt figure it out
My phone sounded OK  not great  OK but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it
While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop
Leopard Print is wonderfully wild
Works for me
Saggy floppy piece of junk
much better than the hard plastic cases
It also had a new problem
Happy so far
cool phone
Works good
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two
but it is great i would really recommend it
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when Im not wearing it
As I said abovePRETTY USELESS
Never got it
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had soundwise
 down the drain because of a weak snap
Does not charge the Cingular ATT 8525 phone
You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off
However after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldnt receive and place calls
I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase
Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside
A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I
I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine
The mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low
Im returning them
I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable
I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family
Otherwise easy to install and use clear sound
nice leather
I had to purchase a different case
It is a joy to use
Very much disappointed with this company
Very satisifed with that
It didnt charge for me
This is the phone to get for 2005 I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW
Buttons are too small
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW
Love it Great armband
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic
However the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and Im pretty happy with that decision
I was very impressed with the price of the cases
Also makes it easier to hold on to
I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great
Its pretty easy
I cannot make calls at certain places
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does
Beautiful styling though
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back
Im trying to return it for a refund
I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked
Excellent product
Earbud piece breaks easily
Lousy product
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet
SWEETEST PHONE
Oh the charger seems to work fine
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal
Not enough volume
Echo ProblemVery unsatisfactory
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor
dont waste your money
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product
Adapter does not provide enough charging current
There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best my mistake
You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered
Phone falls out easily
It didnt work people can not hear me when I talk
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use
Im really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesnt work
Painful on the ear
Lasted one day and then blew up
disappointed
Kind of flops around
The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face
What a piece of junk I lose more calls on this phone
Item Does Not Match Picture
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda
You can not answer calls with the unit never worked once
